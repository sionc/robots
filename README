This is a rails application based on the example in Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial book
available on http://ruby.railstutorial.org/.

The goal of this website is to help robot enthusiasts to upload information about their
robot projects, share ideas and track each others progress.

This website is an individual task deliverable for Carnegie Mellon University Silicon
Valley's Foundation of Software Engineering class.

Special thanks to Michael Hartl!
